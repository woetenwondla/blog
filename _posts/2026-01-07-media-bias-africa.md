In an increasingly complex world, it gets more and more challenging to find decisions, which meet the needs of various stakeholders. It is especially dangerous to have a biased world view, which we are often not even fully aware of ourselves. These subconscious world views guide us through the world and greatly determine the outcomes of our lifes. As Carl Jung once said:"Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate."

One way to be more aware, in order to make more conscious and confident decisions, is to consistently learn about the surroundings one navigates through. One of the biases one might have is a negative perception of Africa, where Africa is dominated by poverty, conflicts and corruption. However, this is an old perception, which does not hold up to the realities nowadays. Anyways, it is still told by mainstream media, due to a demand by their domestic audience.

A recent global media analysis outlines a tremendous negative bias in all major global news outlets. Most media stories are focused on the negative events, have limited geographical scope and diversity of spokespeople as well as depth of coverage.

However, there is a lot more to report about Africa. A promising economic development, high tourism, engaged youth and big resources of highly important minerals for todays technological world. It is a different side of Africa, which has empirically evidence in data. 
As noted, the economy in many African countries is greatly improving, resulting in new emerging markets and a growing middle class.
    
While it is not only great to hear this positive development, it is also a chance for many European businesses to expand their market. Because the European market is already satisfied, this is a new opportunity for win-win deals. Furthermore investing early in a market offers the chance for owning a bigger market share later.

Due to these attractive chances, it would be a mistake to be guided by misconceptions from media biases. In order for good investment decisions, it is necessary to check sources and use a broad array of them. Also calculate in a negative bias for mainstream media. If possible, it is best to check for yourself, if you have the chance and make your own decisions from your collected data. With these recommendations, I wish you good success on your endeavours.
